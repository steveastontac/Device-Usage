# Device-Usage
This is a python script i have written to provide statistics of your windows computer usage . 

Usage is simple .

Extract 
```Desktop.zip```
on your desktop 

from the extracted files 
import 
```Timer Starter.xml```
to your task scheduler .

>Once you complete the above steps the app will automatically start when u turn on your pc and keep track of everything including 
the time you spend on the lockscreen .

>Use the statistics.py to find statistics for the current day . Find them in the csvs folder .

>BONUS : Since i sometimes loose control and watch dirty stuff on my pc ,  I added code to immediately close your browser WITHOUT WARNING whenever u use the keywords specified under the ```parental control starts``` on the timerauto.py file .
